	abstract = {Accurate evaluation of combustion enthalpy is of high scientific and industrial importance. Although ab-initio computation of the heat of reactions is one of the promising and well-established approaches in computational chemistry, reliable and precise computation of heat of combustion reactions by ab-initio methods is surprisingly scarce in the literature. A handful of works carried out for this purpose report significant inconsistencies between the computed and experimentally determined combustion enthalpies and suggest empirical corrections to improve the accuracy of the ab-initio predicted data. The main aim of the present study is to investigate the reasons behind those reported inconsistencies and propose guidelines for a high-accuracy estimation of heat of reactions via ab-initio computations. We show comparably accurate prediction of combustion enthalpy of 40 organic molecules based on a {DSD}-{PBEP}86 double-hybrid density functional theory approach and {CCSD}(T)-F12 coupled-cluster computations, with mean unsigned errors with respect to experimental data being below 0.5\% for both methods.},

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties of the synthetic missile fuel exo- and endo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene ({THDCPD}, {JP}-10) using density functional theory ({DFT}). It is to understand the dominance of the liquid exo-isomer (96\%) of the jet fuel from the subtle differences between the isomers. The present {DFT} calculations reveal that the exo-isomer is 15.51 {kJ}/mol more stable than the endo-isomer, attributed to the flipping of the triangular ΔC8-C10-C9 ring in its norbornane skeleton. Calculated nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-{NMR}) and infrared ({IR}) spectra, validated by experimental data, reveal larger chemical shifts for junction carbons (C1/C2 and C3/C4) due to reduced electron shielding and show distinct vibrational patterns. Charge analysis indicates that all carbon atoms are negatively charged except for the C1/C2 carbons which are positively charged in both isomers. While overall {IR} spectra of the isomers appear similar, bands near 3000 cm−1 correspond to distinctly different vibrational modes. The exo-isomer’s electronic structure features a more delocalized {HOMO} and a larger {HOMO}-{LUMO} gap (7.63 {eV}) than the endo-isomer (7.37 {eV}). All such differences contribute to the properties of exo-{THDCPD} and, therefore, why the exo-isomer dominates {JP}-10 fuel.},

	abstract = {Conformal Prediction ({CP}) is a distribution-free Machine Learning ({ML}) framework that has been developed in the last ∼25 years to provide well calibrated prediction subsets/intervals that include the true label with a user pre-defined probability, only requiring data exchangeability. It is based on the concept of nonconformity (or dissimilarity) of the new prediction compared to previous data and their predictions, so that the prediction subset/interval size is larger for new “unusual” instances and smaller for “typical” instances. Given its simplicity and ease of applicability, since 2012 it has been widely adopted in Cheminformatics, especially in the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ({QSAR}) modeling and Molecular Screening areas. This rapid popularization of {CP} in Cheminformatics can be explained on the grounds that: (a) it can handle the applicability domain ({AD}) issue of {ML} models, of large importance in Cheminformatics due to the immense size of the chemical space; (b) it deals with classification of heavily imbalanced datasets typical in Molecular Screening; and (c) it quantifies compound-specific prediction uncertainties, especially useful as it allows to implement gain-cost strategies to accelerate drug discovery by reducing compounds to test. This comprehensive review introduces the method, provides a full appraisal of the work done in the field of Cheminformatics (with special emphasis in the {QSAR} and Molecular Screening arenas), and discusses its pros and cons and new challenges, especially for Deep Learning applications and nonexchangeable datasets, a very frequent situation in Cheminformatics.},

	abstract = {The push toward sustainable aviation fuels ({SAFs}) is intensifying in response to global decarbonization efforts. This review discusses the development and assessment of probabilistic fuel property prediction methods in use today and vital for the formulation of these next-generation {SAFs}. We discuss the rigorous quality assurance specifications necessary for aviation fuels before they can be integrated into the supply network, with a particular emphasis on the stringent requirements for non-petroleum-based fuels or synthetic aviation turbine fuels. In this review, the relative merit of predictions based on component data and predictions derived from other modeling approaches is discussed. A total of 16 scalar products between a concentration vector (mass, mole, or volume fraction) and a property vector can be used to estimate 31 properties, counting the whole distillation curve as one property. The accuracy of these blending rules, as applied to mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the jet fuel volatility range, is documented here. The relative contribution of blending rule accuracy to the fuel property prediction uncertainty is discussed. In most (if not all) cases, the predictive uncertainty is small relative to uncertainties arising from incomplete characterization of the component concentration or property data and/or the accuracy of reported component property data. The data used to populate the property vector comes from authoritative sources, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}), the Design Institute for Physical Properties ({DIPPR}), and the periodic table of elements, or internal measurements. Additionally, the freeze point can be estimated from the crucial components’ concentration and property data from a simple equation-of-state model (enthalpy, entropy, and temperature) applied to each of the crucial components. A total of 75 additional “properties” with specified criteria stated in {ASTM} D4054 follow directly from the measurement of trace or bulk materials or can be determined exactly from blending rules that invoke the conservation of mass. A total of 20 properties listed in {ASTM} D4054 are not discussed in this review. A total of 16 of the 20 properties not listed here are believed to depend upon trace level impurities (such as the jet fuel thermal oxidation test or {JFTOT}), lacking identification or composition data, while simple blending rules are not advised for the remainder.},

	abstract = {As the global aviation industry faces increasing demands for carbon reduction, the need for sustainable aviation fuel ({SAF}) is also rising. {SAF} is similar to traditional kerosene-based aviation fuel but has significantly lower carbon emissions. This reduction is achieved through various routes, including carbon capture technologies and the use of biogenic-carbon feedstock, such as biomass, which contribute to overall emission reduction. However, as a new alternative fuel, {SAF}'s application is limited due to a lack of awareness among countries and the absence of relevant regulations. This paper provides an overview of the current state of kerosene-based aviation fuel, the advantages of {SAF}, and analyzes the development potential and market for {SAF}, drawing on international regulatory experiences and mainstream production routes. Additionally, it organizes the certification systems and standards for {SAF} and discusses its techno-economic viability, technological maturity, and environmental benefits, particularly in terms of carbon emissions reduction. Finally, recommendations for the future development of {SAF} are provided to guide the aviation industry's green transition and the comprehensive market application of {SAF}.},

	abstract = {In this work, a Variational Autoencoder ({VAE})-based data-driven modeling framework is developed with the overarching goal of enabling fuel design. The {VAE} model is trained on a large dataset with several chemical species to learn a compressed latent space molecular representation. Chemical structure in the form of Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System ({SMILES}) string is fed as input, encoded into the {VAE} latent space, and decoded back to the {SMILES} string using Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) networks. Complexities of the {VAE} training loss function are thoroughly examined by varying the weightage (beta (𝜷) parameter) of the latent space regularization term, thereby assessing the balance between reconstruction accuracy and validity, and focusing on both accurate molecular structure reconstruction and latent space consistency. Two different strategies for 𝜷 variation are evaluated: linear annealing and cyclic annealing. In addition, the impact of total correlation adjustment and hierarchical priors is also studied with regard to the balance between reconstruction fidelity and latent space regularization, and potential issues such as posterior collapse, over-regularization, and poor disentanglement of latent variables. Overall, the best performance of the model is achieved with hierarchical priors and incrementally increasing 𝜷 from 0 to a threshold value of 0.25 over 75 epochs. The generative {VAE} model can be readily coupled with Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship ({QSPR}) analysis to develop an integrated end-to-end framework for fuel-property prediction and molecular design of novel promising fuels.},

	abstract = {Fuel design is usually “forward”: candidate molecular structures are designed first, and then their properties are predicted for screening. Owing to the large latent space of organic molecules (1060 order), reverse design by giving target fuel properties is urgently needed. However, it is hardly realized due to the unknown complex rule of the structure–property relationship. In this work, reverse design of hydrocarbon fuels is realized based on the conditional generative adversarial network of hydrocarbon molecules. Two deep generative models, c-{GAN} and c-{infoGAN}, are established and trained for generating new candidate fuel molecules when target fuel properties are input. c-{infoGAN} exhibited superior generation ability in terms of the validity, uniqueness, and novelty of the as-generated molecules. {JP}-10, a classical hydrocarbon fuel, was rediscovered by c-{infoGAN}. The latent space of fuels constructed by c-{infoGAN} is ordered, as proved by linear interpolation and linear algebra in this high-dimensional space. Given the target of high density, low freezing point, high heating value, and large specific impulse, 27 new fuel molecules with novel structures, high diversity, and expecting properties were designed. One of the as-designed fuels was experimentally synthesized and tested, which verifies the robust design ability of c-{infoGAN}. This work opens new avenues for the design of new hydrocarbon fuels to meet the strict requirements of next-generation engines.},

	abstract = {Antioxidants are indispensable additives for ensuring the long-term stability, performance, and reliability of aviation fuels. They prevent the formation of gum and other insoluble deposits in the fuel which clog fuel systems, leading to engine problems. This is achieved by inhibiting free radical chain reactions involved in the oxidation of hydrocarbons in the fuel. The compound 2,4-Dimethyl-6-tert-butyl phenol ({DTBP}) is one of the widely used antioxidants in aviation fuels. In this report, the radical scavenging done by {DTBP} is analysed computationally by density functional theory ({DFT}) with the model chemistry X/6-31+G(d,p), where X represents certain Minnesota functionals such as {MN}15, M05-2X, M06-2X, M08-{HX}, and M11. Among the well-known modes of radical scavenging, namely {HAT}, {SETPT}, and {SPLET}, the {HAT} mode is preferred in the gaseous phase, while {SPLET} operates in non-polar solvents, as computations indicate. Fukui indices, global reactivity descriptors, electronic spectra, and natural bond orbitals ({NBOs}) are also generated to explain the results. Understanding the mechanism of radical scavenging is important in designing powerful and efficient antioxidants for aviation fuels such as jet fuel, aviation gasoline, Jet B, and bio-kerosene.},

One way to more rapidly reduce the dependency on fossil fuels in transport is to replace them with biofuels. Evaluating the potential of different biofuels in different applications requires knowledge of their physicochemical properties. In chemistry, message passing neural networks ({MPNNs}) correlating the atoms and bonds of a molecule to properties have shown promising results in predicting the properties of individual chemical components. In this article a machine learning approach, developed from the message passing neural network called Chemprop, is evaluated for the prediction of multiple properties of organic molecules (containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen). A novel approach using transfer learning based on estimated property values from theoretical estimation methods is applied. Moreover, the effect of multi-task learning ({MTL}) on the predictions of fuel properties is evaluated. The result show that both transfer learning and multi-task learning are good strategies to improve the accuracy of the predicted values, and that accurate predictions for multiple fuel properties can be obtained using this approach.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Production of sustainable aviation fuels ({SAFs}) can significantly reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. Current pathways that produce {SAFs} in significant volumes from ethanol and fatty acids can be costly, have a relatively high carbon intensity ({CI}), and impose sustainability challenges. There is a need for a diversified approach to reduce costs and utilize more sustainable feedstocks effectively. Here, we map out catalytic synthesis routes to convert furanics derived from the (hemi)cellulosic biomass to alkanes and cycloalkanes using automated network generation with {RING} and semiempirical thermochemistry calculations. We find {\textgreater}100 energy-dense C8–C16 alkane and cycloalkane {SAF} candidates over 300 synthesis routes; the top three are 2-methyl heptane, ethyl cyclohexane, and propyl cyclohexane, although these are relatively short. The shortest, least endothermic process chemistry involves C–C coupling, oxygen removal, and hydrogen addition, with dehydracyclization of the heterocyclic oxygens in the furan ring being the most endothermic step. The global warming potential due to hydrogen use and byproduct {CO}2 is typically 0.7–1 kg {CO}2/kg {SAF} product; the least {CO}2 emitting routes entail making larger molecules with fewer ketonization, hydrogenation, and hydrodeoxygenation steps. The large number of {SAF} candidates highlights the rich potential of furanics as a source of {SAF} molecules. However, the structural dissimilarity between reactants and target products precludes pathways with fewer than six synthetic steps, thus necessitating intensified processes, integrating multiple reaction steps in multifunctional catalytic reactors.},

The fuel properties of the molecules were evaluated by using group-contribution methods and density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations, where {ZD}-6 stood out due to the high volumetric net heat of combustion, high specific impulse, low melting point, and acceptable flash point. Based on the neural network model for evaluating the synthetic complexity ({SCScore}), the estimated value of {ZD}-6 was close to that of syntin, indicating that the synthetic complexity of {ZD}-6 was comparable to that of syntin.

	abstract = {In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-{VAE}) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship ({QSPR}) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-{VAE} integrates a property prediction component coupled with the {VAE} latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number ({RON}) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the {GDB}-13 database, enriched with a curated {RON} database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and {RON} prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine {RON} prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the {VAE} latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high {RON}. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model provides a flexible tool for systematically exploring vast chemical spaces, paving the way for discovering fuels with superior anti-knock properties. The demonstrated approach can be readily extended to incorporate additional fuel properties and synthesizability criteria to enhance applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.},

	abstract = {Structure-based drug design aims to generate molecules that fill the cavity of the protein pocket with a high binding affinity. Many contemporary studies employ sequential generative models. Their standard training method is to sequentialize molecular graphs into ordered sequences and then maximize the likelihood of the resulting sequences. However, the exact likelihood is computationally intractable, which involves a sum over all possible sequential orders. Molecular graphs lack an inherent order and the number of orders is factorial in the graph size. To avoid the intractable full space of factorially-many orders, existing works pre-define a fixed node ordering scheme such as depth-first search to sequentialize the 3D molecular graphs. In these cases, the training objectives are loose lower bounds of the exact likelihoods which are suboptimal for generation. To address the challenges, we propose a unified generative framework named {MolEM} to learn the 3D molecular graphs and corresponding sequential orders jointly. We derive a tight lower bound of the likelihood and maximize it via variational expectation-maximization algorithm, opening a new line of research in learning-based ordering schemes for 3D molecular graph generation. Besides, we first incorporate the molecular docking method {QuickVina} 2 to manipulate the binding poses, leading to accurate and flexible ligand conformations. Experimental results demonstrate that {MolEM} significantly outperforms baseline models in generating molecules with high binding affinities and realistic structures. Our approach efficiently approximates the true marginal graph likelihood and identifies reasonable orderings for 3D molecular graphs, aligning well with relevant chemical priors.},

This study explores the influence of minor change in oxygen concentration on {NO} formation in the primary combustion zone under deep air-staged combustion by experimental and density functional theory ({DFT}). Experimental results show that there is an optimal oxygen concentration for {NOx} formation under the deep staged combustion. The theoretical calculation further verifies the experimental results, and reveals that char model with one hydroxyl group is more conducive to the N2 desorption than the char model with two hydroxyl groups at the mechanism level. Oxygen changes the reaction pathway of char-{NO}, and the reduction of {NO} to N2 is accompanied by the formation of {CO} or {CO}2. Moreover, the char and {CO}2 gasification reaction promotes {CO} formation under low oxygen condition under deep air staging. The kinetic analysis also reveals that there is an optimal concentration of oxygen in promoting {CNO} heterogeneous reduction. The carbonaceous surface with one hydroxyl group enhances char reactivity and increases the desorption rate of N2 compared to char surface without hydroxyl group. The char surface containing two hydroxyl groups promotes the retention of the pyridine nitrogen in the structurally stable aromatic ring, which greatly reduces the N2 desorption rate and inhibits {NO} reduction.},

	abstract = {Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence ({AI}) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system ({SMILES}) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) to discrete data. This study introduces {RL}-{MolGAN}, a novel Transformer-based discrete {GAN} framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, {RL}-{MolGAN} utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both \$de{\textasciitilde}novo\$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, {RL}-{MolGAN} integrates reinforcement learning ({RL}) and Monte Carlo tree search ({MCTS}) techniques to enhance the stability of {GAN} training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, {RL}-{MolWGAN}, an extension of {RL}-{MolGAN}, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the {GAN}. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, {QM}9 and {ZINC}, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.},

	abstract = {Co-design of alternative fuels and future spark-ignition ({SI}) engines allows very high engine efficiencies to be achieved. To tailor the fuel’s molecular structure to the needs of {SI} engines with very high compression ratios, computer-aided molecular design ({CAMD}) of renewable fuels has received considerable attention over the past decade. To date, {CAMD} for fuels is typically performed by computationally screening the physicochemical properties of single molecules against property targets. However, achievable {SI} engine efficiency is the result of the combined effect of various fuel properties, and molecules should not be discarded because of individual unfavorable properties that can be compensated for. Therefore, we present an optimization-based fuel design method directly targeting {SI} engine efficiency as the objective function. Specifically, we employ an empirical model to assess the achievable relative engine efficiency increase compared to conventional {RON}95 gasoline for each candidate fuel as a function of fuel properties. For this purpose, we integrate the automated prediction of various fuel properties into the fuel design method: Thermodynamic properties are calculated by {COSMO}-{RS}; combustion properties, indicators for environment, health and safety, and synthesizability are predicted using machine learning models. The method is applied to design pure-component fuels and binary ethanol-containing fuel blends. The optimal pure-component fuel tert-butyl formate is predicted to yield a relative efficiency increase of approximately 8\% and the optimal fuel blend with ethanol and 3,4-dimethyl-3-propan-2-yl-1-pentene of 19\%.},

To evaluate the potential of novel fuels it is crucial to first determine their combustion and spray related properties. This can be done experimentally, but during screening of multiple fuel candidates this can be cost and time expensive. Machine learning can be used for rapid, inexpensive, and accurate predictions of fuel mixture properties. To this end a novel function for pooling molecular representations called {MolPool} has been developed, which was combined with graph neural networks. The new approach processes the input permutation invariant, allowing for application to a varying number of components in the mixture. In this article, three different compression ignition engine related properties were investigated: derived cetane number ({DCN}), flashpoint, and viscosity. The results show that this novel neural network approach is able to increase the prediction accuracy and the generalizibility compared to traditional blending laws for all investigated properties. {MolPool} improves the prediction if oxygenated species are present in the mixture resulting in non-linear mixture behavior, which is common for renewable fuels. Thus, {MolPool} shows great potential for prediction of various properties and fuel mixtures.},

	abstract = {While a multitude of deep generative models have recently emerged there exists no best practice for their practically relevant validation. On the one hand, novel de novo-generated molecules cannot be refuted by retrospective validation (so that this type of validation is biased); but on the other hand prospective validation is expensive and then often biased by the human selection process. In this case study, we frame retrospective validation as the ability to mimic human drug design, by answering the following question: Can a generative model trained on early-stage project compounds generate middle/late-stage compounds de novo? To this end, we used experimental data that contains the elapsed time of a synthetic expansion following hit identification from five public (where the time series was pre-processed to better reflect realistic synthetic expansions) and six in-house project datasets, and used {REINVENT} as a widely adopted {RNN}-based generative model. After splitting the dataset and training {REINVENT} on early-stage compounds, we found that rediscovery of middle/late-stage compounds was much higher in public projects (at 1.60\%, 0.64\%, and 0.21\% of the top 100, 500, and 5000 scored generated compounds) than in in-house projects (where the values were 0.00\%, 0.03\%, and 0.04\%, respectively). Similarly, average single nearest neighbour similarity between early- and middle/late-stage compounds in public projects was higher between active compounds than inactive compounds; however, for in-house projects the converse was true, which makes rediscovery (if so desired) more difficult. We hence show that the generative model recovers very few middle/late-stage compounds from real-world drug discovery projects, highlighting the fundamental difference between purely algorithmic design and drug discovery as a real-world process. Evaluating de novo compound design approaches appears, based on the current study, difficult or even impossible to do retrospectively. Scientific Contribution This contribution hence illustrates aspects of evaluating the performance of generative models in a real-world setting which have not been extensively described previously and which hopefully contribute to their further future development.},

This has prioritized the scalability and multiobjectivity of drug discovery and design. De novo drug design has emerged as a promising approach; molecules are generated from scratch, thus reducing the reliance on trial and error and premade molecular repositories. However, optimizing for molecular traits remains challenging, impeding the implementation of de novo methods. In this work, we propose a de novo approach capable of optimizing multiple traits collectively. A recurrent neural network was used to generate molecules which were then ranked based on multiple properties by a nondominated sorting algorithm. The best of the molecules generated were selected and used to fine-tune the recurrent neural network through transfer learning, creating a cycle that mimics the traditional design–synthesis–test cycle. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a proof of concept, optimizing for constraints on molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient, the number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors, and hydrogen bond acceptors simultaneously. Analysis of the molecules generated after five iterations of the cycle revealed a 14-fold improvement in the quality of generated molecules, along with improvements to the accuracy of the recurrent neural network and the structural diversity of the molecules generated. This cycle notably does not require large amounts of training data nor any handwritten scoring functions. Altogether, this approach uniquely combines scalable generation with multiobjective optimization of molecules.},

	abstract = {{ConspectusOne} of the simplest questions that can be asked about molecular diversity is how many organic molecules are possible in total? To answer this question, my research group has computationally enumerated all possible organic molecules up to a certain size to gain an unbiased insight into the entire chemical space. Our latest database, {GDB}-17, contains 166.4 billion molecules of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens, by far the largest small molecule database reported to date. Molecules allowed by valency rules but unstable or nonsynthesizable due to strained topologies or reactive functional groups were not considered, which reduced the enumeration by at least 10 orders of magnitude and was essential to arrive at a manageable database size. Despite these restrictions, {GDB}-17 is highly relevant with respect to known molecules.Beyond enumeration, understanding and exploiting {GDBs} (generated databases) led us to develop methods for virtual screening and visualization of very large databases in the form of a “periodic system of molecules” comprising six different fingerprint spaces, with web-browsers for nearest neighbor searches, and the {MQN}- and {SMIfp}-Mapplet application for exploring color-coded principal component maps of {GDB} and other large databases. Proof-of-concept applications of {GDB} for drug discovery were realized by combining virtual screening with chemical synthesis and activity testing for neurotransmitter receptor and transporter ligands. One surprising lesson from using {GDB} for drug analog searches is the incredible depth of chemical space, that is, the fact that millions of very close analogs of any molecule can be readily identified by nearest-neighbor searches in the {MQN}-space of the various {GDBs}. The chemical space project has opened an unprecedented door on chemical diversity. Ongoing and yet unmet challenges concern enumerating molecules beyond 17 atoms and synthesizing {GDB} molecules with innovative scaffolds and pharmacophores.},

Among the current approaches, directed message-passing neural networks (D-{MPNNs}) have proven to perform well on a variety of property prediction tasks. The software package Chemprop implements the D-{MPNN} architecture and offers simple, easy, and fast access to machine-learned molecular properties. Compared to its initial version, we present a multitude of new Chemprop functionalities such as the support of multimolecule properties, reactions, atom/bond-level properties, and spectra. Further, we incorporate various uncertainty quantification and calibration methods along with related metrics as well as pretraining and transfer learning workflows, improved hyperparameter optimization, and other customization options concerning loss functions or atom/bond features. We benchmark D-{MPNN} models trained using Chemprop with the new reaction, atom-level, and spectra functionality on a variety of property prediction data sets, including {MoleculeNet} and {SAMPL}, and observe state-of-the-art performance on the prediction of water-octanol partition coefficients, reaction barrier heights, atomic partial charges, and absorption spectra. Chemprop enables out-of-the-box training of D-{MPNN} models for a variety of problem settings in fast, user-friendly, and open-source software.},

	abstract = {A method to estimate ease of synthesis (synthetic accessibility) of drug-like molecules is needed in many areas of the drug discovery process. The development and validation of such a method that is able to characterize molecule synthetic accessibility as a score between 1 (easy to make) and 10 (very difficult to make) is described in this article. The method for estimation of the synthetic accessibility score ({SAscore}) described here is based on a combination of fragment contributions and a complexity penalty. Fragment contributions have been calculated based on the analysis of one million representative molecules from {PubChem} and therefore one can say that they capture historical synthetic knowledge stored in this database. The molecular complexity score takes into account the presence of non-standard structural features, such as large rings, non-standard ring fusions, stereocomplexity and molecule size. The method has been validated by comparing calculated {SAscores} with ease of synthesis as estimated by experienced medicinal chemists for a set of 40 molecules. The agreement between calculated and manually estimated synthetic accessibility is very good with r2 = 0.89. A novel method to estimate synthetic accessibility of molecules has been developed. This method uses historical synthetic knowledge obtained by analyzing information from millions of already synthesized chemicals and considers also molecule complexity. The method is sufficiently fast and provides results consistent with estimation of ease of synthesis by experienced medicinal chemists. The calculated {SAscore} may be used to support various drug discovery processes where a large number of molecules needs to be ranked based on their synthetic accessibility, for example when purchasing samples for screening, selecting hits from high-throughput screening for follow-up, or ranking molecules generated by various de novo design approaches.},

We have therefore developed {ZINC}20, a new version of {ZINC} with two major new features: billions of new molecules and new methods to search them. As a fully enumerated database, {ZINC} can be searched precisely using explicit atomic-level graph-based methods, such as {SmallWorld} for similarity and Arthor for pattern and substructure search, as well as 3D methods such as docking. Analysis of the new make-on-demand compound sets by these and related tools reveals startling features. For instance, over 97\% of the core Bemis–Murcko scaffolds in make-on-demand libraries are unavailable from “in-stock” collections. Correspondingly, the number of new Bemis–Murcko scaffolds is rising almost as a linear fraction of the elaborated molecules. Thus, an 88-fold increase in the number of molecules in the make-on-demand versus the in-stock sets is built upon a 16-fold increase in the number of Bemis–Murcko scaffolds. The make-on-demand library is also more structurally diverse than physical libraries, with a massive increase in disc- and sphere-like shaped molecules.

A common approach is to train a generative model on {SMILES} strings and then use this to generate {SMILES} strings for molecules with a desired property. Unfortunately, these {SMILES} strings are often not syntactically valid due to elements of {SMILES} syntax that must occur in pairs.{ResultsWe} describe a {SMILES}-like syntax called {DeepSMILES} that addresses two of the main reasons for invalid syntax when using a probabilistic model to generate {SMILES} strings. The {DeepSMILES} syntax avoids the problem of unbalanced parentheses by only using close parentheses, where the number of parentheses indicates the branch length. In addition, {DeepSMILES} avoids the problem of pairing ring closure symbols by using only a single symbol at the ring closing location, where the symbol indicates the ring size. We show that this syntax can be interconverted to/from {SMILES} with string processing without any loss of information, including stereo configuration.{ConclusionWe} believe that {DeepSMILES} will be useful, not just for those using {SMILES} in deep neural networks, but also for other computational methods that use {SMILES} as the basis for generating molecular structures such as genetic algorithms.},

We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern {GAN} baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic {GAN} loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, this loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common {GANs} with modern architectures. Using {StyleGAN}2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline---R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses {StyleGAN}2 on {FFHQ}, {ImageNet}, {CIFAR}, and Stacked {MNIST} datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art {GANs} and diffusion models.

We conduct a neutral, multi-faceted large-scale empirical study on state-of-the art models and evaluation measures. We find that most models can reach similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise from a higher computational budget and tuning more than fundamental algorithmic changes. To overcome some limitations of the current metrics, we also propose several data sets on which precision and recall can be computed. Our experimental results suggest that future {GAN} research should be based on more systematic and objective evaluation procedures. Finally, we did not find evidence that any of the tested algorithms consistently outperforms the non-saturating {GAN} introduced in {\textbackslash}cite\{goodfellow2014generative\}.},

	abstract = {Deep generative models are used to generate arbitrary molecular structures with the desired chemical properties. {MolGAN} is a renowned molecular generation models that uses generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) and reinforcement learning to generate molecular graphs in one shot. {MolGAN} can effectively generate a small molecular graph with nine or fewer heavy atoms. However, the graphs tend to become disconnected as the molecular size increase. This poses a challenge to drug discovery and material design, where large molecules are potentially inclusive. This study develops an improved {MolGAN} for large molecule generation (L-{MolGAN}). In this model, the connectivity of molecular graphs is evaluated by a depth-first search during the model training process. When a disconnected molecular graph is generated, L-{MolGAN} rewards the graph a zero score. This procedure decreases the number of disconnected graphs, and consequently increases the number of connected molecular graphs. The effectiveness of L-{MolGAN} is experimentally evaluated. The size and connectivity of the molecular graphs generated with data from the {ZINC}-250k molecular dataset are confirmed using {MolGAN} as the baseline model. The model is then optimized for a quantitative estimate of drug-likeness ({QED}) to generate drug-like molecules. The experimental results indicate that the connectivity measure of generated molecular graphs improved by 1.96 compared with the baseline model at a larger maximum molecular size of 20 atoms. The molecules generated by L-{MolGAN} are evaluated in terms of multiple chemical properties, {QED}, synthetic accessibility, and log octanol–water partition coefficient, which are important in drug design. This result confirms that L-{MolGAN} can generate various drug-like molecules despite being optimized for a single property, i.e., {QED}. This method will contribute to the efficient discovery of new molecules of larger sizes than those being generated with the existing method.},

We introduce a class of {CNNs} called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks ({DCGANs}), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

In this work, we describe for the first time a deep learning system for generating 3D molecular structures conditioned on a receptor binding site. We approach the problem using a conditional variational autoencoder trained on an atomic density grid representation of cross-docked protein–ligand structures. We apply atom fitting and bond inference procedures to construct valid molecular conformations from generated atomic densities. We evaluate the properties of the generated molecules and demonstrate that they change significantly when conditioned on mutated receptors.

Therefore, inverse design methods aim to start from the desired property and optimize a corresponding chemical structure. From a machine learning viewpoint, the inverse design problem can be addressed through so-called generative modeling. Mathematically, discriminative models are defined by learning the probability distribution function of properties given the molecular or material structure. In contrast, a generative model seeks to exploit the joint probability of a chemical species with target characteristics. The overarching idea of generative modeling is to implement a system that produces novel compounds that are expected to have a desired set of chemical features, effectively sidestepping issues found in the forward design process. In this contribution, we overview and critically analyze popular generative algorithms like generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow, and diffusion models. We highlight key differences between each of the models, provide insights into recent success stories, and discuss outstanding challenges for realizing generative modeling discovered solutions in chemical applications.},

Among the many molecular generative models, a generative adversarial network ({GAN}), is able to generate molecule structures with desirable chemical properties via reinforcement learning. Generating valid molecules is the foremost task of any molecular generative model, since invalid molecules cannot be synthesized. We base our research on a molecular generative adversarial network ({MolGAN}) architecture to investigate how the validity score is influenced in different scenarios. First, we verify that the Vanilla {GAN} structure can produce valid molecules in measure, and that the reward network, along with Vanilla {GAN}, can further increase the validity score in a reinforcement learning manner. Then, the procedure for solely optimizing the validity score is tested, followed by an assessment of validity score maintenance while other chemical properties are being optimized. We found that multiple aspects, including loss functions, hyper parameters, and training sequences, must be carefully considered and optimized to raise the validity score of molecular generation alone or in concurrence with the optimizing of other chemical property scores.},

Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design by directly generating novel materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can only satisfy a limited set of property constraints 4−11. Here, we present {MatterGen}, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared to prior generative models 4,12, structures produced by {MatterGen} are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 10 times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, {MatterGen} successfully generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20 \% of our target.

Recently, a machine learning method, graph neural networks ({GNNs}), has shown promising results for the prediction of structure–property relationships. {GNNs} utilize a graph representation of molecules, where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds to edges containing information about the molecular structure. More specifically, {GNNs} learn physicochemical properties as a function of the molecular graph in a supervised learning setup using a backpropagation algorithm. This end-to-end learning approach eliminates the need for selection of molecular descriptors or structural groups, as it learns optimal fingerprints through graph convolutions and maps the fingerprints to the physicochemical properties by deep learning. We develop {GNN} models for predicting three fuel ignition quality indicators, i.e., the derived cetane number ({DCN}), the research octane number ({RON}), and the motor octane number ({MON}), of oxygenated and nonoxygenated hydrocarbons. In light of limited experimental data in the order of hundreds, we propose a combination of multitask learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning. The results show competitive performance of the proposed {GNN} approach compared to state-of-the-art {QSPR} models, making it a promising field for future research.

	abstract = {Co-optimization of fuels and engines can help decarbonize the transportation sector. Traditional methods for fuel-engine co-optimization rely on experimental or theoretical approaches for determining relationships between fuel molecular properties and engine performance. However, these methods can be expensive and time consuming to develop and are prone to errors when there are complex non-linear relationships between molecular structure and combustion properties. Data-driven approaches that rely on artificial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning ({ML}) algorithms are gaining interest for their versatility, adaptability, and ease of use. This paper provides an overview of {AI} and {ML} methods and their applications in fuel design. {ML} algorithms are now routinely developed to predict quantitative structure property relationships ({QSPR}) for combustion applications. However, molecular representations relying on descriptors are limited to iterative screening of molecules or mixtures for fuel design; they do not enable inverse fuel design wherein a fuel's structure or composition is predicted based on desired target properties. Inverse fuel design is enabled by using {AI}/{ML} methods to train {QSPR} models using molecular graphs and neural networks for a fully differentiable mapping of molecular structure to fuel properties. Gradient-based search methods can then be employed on the latent space representation to generate novel fuel components or mixtures. While {AI} for fuel design is an evolving domain, the need for uncertainty quantification in training data and model parameters cannot be overlooked. Methods for addressing aleatoric and epistemic are discussed herein together with outlooks for their applications in fuel design.},

However, whether designed by {AI} or human experts, the molecules need to be accessibly synthesized and biologically evaluated, and the trial-and-error process remains a resources-intensive endeavor. Therefore, {AI}-based drug design methods face a major challenge of how to prioritize the molecular structures with potential for subsequent drug development. This study indicates that common filtering approaches based on traditional screening metrics fail to differentiate {AI}-designed molecules. To address this issue, we propose a novel molecular filtering method, {MolFilterGAN}, based on a progressively augmented generative adversarial network. Comparative analysis shows that {MolFilterGAN} outperforms conventional screening approaches based on drug-likeness or synthetic ability metrics. Retrospective analysis of {AI}-designed discoidin domain receptor 1 ({DDR}1) inhibitors shows that {MolFilterGAN} significantly increases the efficiency of molecular triaging. Further evaluation of {MolFilterGAN} on eight external ligand sets suggests that {MolFilterGAN} is useful in triaging or enriching bioactive compounds across a wide range of target types. These results highlighted the importance of {MolFilterGAN} in evaluating molecules integrally and further accelerating molecular discovery especially combined with advanced {AI} generative models.},

Recurrent-neural-network-based techniques are the most widely used methods in this space. In this work we examine the behaviour of recurrent-neural-network-based methods when there are few (or no) examples of molecules with the desired properties in the training data. We find that targeted molecular generation is usually possible, but the diversity of generated molecules is often reduced and it is not possible to control the composition of generated molecular sets. To help overcome these issues, we propose a new curriculum-learning-inspired recurrent iterative optimization procedure that enables the optimization of generated molecules for seen and unseen molecular profiles, and allows the user to control whether a molecular profile is explored or exploited. Using our method, we generate specific and diverse sets of molecules with up to 18 times more scaffolds than standard methods for the same sample size; however, our results also point to substantial limitations of one-dimensional molecular representations, as used in this space. We find that the success or failure of a given molecular optimization problem depends on the choice of simplified molecular-input line-entry system ({SMILES}).},

	abstract = {One of the crucial objectives in modern drug design is the generation of high-quality novel molecules. Currently, numerous deep learning methods have been applied in the field of molecular generation. Modeling molecules as graph-structured data provides a unique representation that offers richer structural information than sequential data. However, unlike data such as images, conventional embedding methods struggle to capture the topological structure of graphs and distinguish between different types of nodes and edges, leading to a loss of molecular structural information. Additionally, traditional Generative Adversarial Networks({GANs}) often concentrate on fitting training data, leading to a concentrated distribution that limits the diversity of generated molecules. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-{GAN} framework based on molecular graphs to address these challenges. The graph autoencoder effectively embeds molecular graph data, preserving structural information. The Diffusion-{GAN} module progressively introduces noise through a forward diffusion chain to broaden the sampling distribution, thereby enhancing the diversity of generated samples. We conducted molecular graph generation tasks on the {QM}9, {ZINC} and {MOSES} datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Our method exhibits higher validity and diversity than several classical molecular generation algorithms.},

In contrast, the search for novel compounds necessitates exploration beyond the original data. Here, we present an approach to training {GANs} that promotes incremental exploration and limits the impacts of mode collapse using concepts from Genetic Algorithms. In our approach, valid samples from the generator are used to replace samples from the training data. We consider both random and guided selection along with recombination during replacement. By tracking the number of novel compounds produced during training, we show that updates to the training data drastically outperform the traditional approach, increasing potential applications for {GANs} in drug discovery.},

Traditionally matter engineering–generally denoted as inverse design–was based massively on human intuition and high-throughput virtual screening. The last few years have seen the emergence of significant interest in computer-inspired designs based on evolutionary or deep learning methods. The major challenge here is that the standard strings molecular representation {SMILES} shows substantial weaknesses in that task because large fractions of strings do not correspond to valid molecules. Here, we solve this problem at a fundamental level and introduce {SELFIES} ({SELF}-{referencIng} Embedded Strings), a string-based representation of molecules which is 100\% robust. Every {SELFIES} string corresponds to a valid molecule, and {SELFIES} can represent every molecule. {SELFIES} can be directly applied in arbitrary machine learning models without the adaptation of the models; each of the generated molecule candidates is valid. In our experiments, the model’s internal memory stores two orders of magnitude more diverse molecules than a similar test with {SMILES}. Furthermore, as all molecules are valid, it allows for explanation and interpretation of the internal working of the generative models.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

To design compounds that interact with specific target proteins, we propose a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer ({GPT})-inspired model for de novo target-specific molecular design. By implementing different keys and values for the multi-head attention conditional on a specified target, the proposed method can generate drug-like compounds both with and without a specific target. The results show that our approach ({cMolGPT}) is capable of generating {SMILES} strings that correspond to both drug-like and active compounds. Moreover, the compounds generated from the conditional model closely match the chemical space of real target-specific molecules and cover a significant portion of novel compounds. Thus, the proposed Conditional Generative Pre-Trained Transformer ({cMolGPT}) is a valuable tool for de novo molecule design and has the potential to accelerate the molecular optimization cycle time.},

While conventional molecular design involves using human expertise to propose, synthesize, and test new molecules, this process can be cost and time intensive, limiting the number of molecules that can be reasonably tested. Generative modeling provides an alternative approach to molecular discovery by reformulating molecular design as an inverse design problem. Here, we review the recent advances in the state-of-the-art of generative molecular design and discusses the considerations for integrating these models into real molecular discovery campaigns. We first review the model design choices required to develop and train a generative model including common 1D, 2D, and 3D representations of molecules and typical generative modeling neural network architectures. We then describe different problem statements for molecular discovery applications and explore the benchmarks used to evaluate models based on those problem statements. Finally, we discuss the important factors that play a role in integrating generative models into experimental workflows. Our aim is that this review will equip the reader with the information and context necessary to utilize generative modeling within their domain.

Traditional computational methods for exploring the conformational space of molecules such as molecular dynamics simulations, however, require substantial computational resources and time. Recently, deep generative models have made significant progress in various fields, harnessing their powerful learning capabilities for complex data distributions. This makes them highly applicable in molecular conformation generation. In this study, we developed {ConfGAN}, a conformation generation model based on conditional generative adversarial networks. We designed an efficient molecular-motif graph representation, treating molecules composed of functional groups, capturing interactions between groups, and providing rich chemical prior knowledge for conformation generation. During adversarial training, the generator network takes molecular graphs as input and attempts to generate stable conformations with minimal potential energy. The discriminator provides feedback based on energy differences, guiding the generation of conformations that comply with chemical rules. This model explicitly encodes molecular knowledge, ensuring the physical plausibility of generated conformations. Through extensive evaluation, {ConfGAN} has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing deep learning-based models. Furthermore, conformations generated by {ConfGAN} have demonstrated potential applications in related fields such as molecular docking and electronic property calculations.},

While molecular structures produced through generative deep learning will satisfy these patterns, they often only possess specific target properties by chance and not by design, which makes molecular discovery via this route inefficient. In this work, we predict molecules with (Pareto-)optimal properties by combining a generative deep learning model that predicts three-dimensional conformations of molecules with a supervised deep learning model that takes these as inputs and predicts their electronic structure. Optimization of (multiple) molecular properties is achieved by screening newly generated molecules for desirable electronic properties and reusing hit molecules to retrain the generative model with a bias. The approach is demonstrated to find optimal molecules for organic electronics applications. Our method is generally applicable and eliminates the need for quantum chemical calculations during predictions, making it suitable for high-throughput screening in materials and catalyst design.},

	abstract = {Molecular discovery is a multi-objective optimization problem that requires identifying a molecule or set of molecules that balance multiple, often competing, properties. Multi-objective molecular design is commonly addressed by combining properties of interest into a single objective function using scalarization, which imposes assumptions about relative importance and uncovers little about the trade-offs between objectives. In contrast to scalarization, Pareto optimization does not require knowledge of relative importance and reveals the trade-offs between objectives. However, it introduces additional considerations in algorithm design. In this review, we describe pool-based and de novo generative approaches to multi-objective molecular discovery with a focus on Pareto optimization algorithms. We show how pool-based molecular discovery is a relatively direct extension of multi-objective Bayesian optimization and how the plethora of different generative models extend from single-objective to multi-objective optimization in similar ways using non-dominated sorting in the reward function (reinforcement learning) or to select molecules for retraining (distribution learning) or propagation (genetic algorithms). Finally, we discuss some remaining challenges and opportunities in the field, emphasizing the opportunity to adopt Bayesian optimization techniques into multi-objective de novo design.},

Inspired by these successes, researchers are now applying deep generative modeling techniques to the generation and optimization of molecules—in our review we found 45 papers on the subject published in the past two years. These works point to a future where such systems will be used to generate lead molecules, greatly reducing resources spent downstream synthesizing and characterizing bad leads in the lab. In this review we survey the increasingly complex landscape of models and representation schemes that have been proposed. The four classes of techniques we describe are recursive neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. After first discussing some of the mathematical fundamentals of each technique, we draw high level connections and comparisons with other techniques and expose the pros and cons of each. Several important high level themes emerge as a result of this work, including the shift away from the {SMILES} string representation of molecules towards more sophisticated representations such as graph grammars and 3D representations, the importance of reward function design, the need for better standards for benchmarking and testing, and the benefits of adversarial training and reinforcement learning over maximum likelihood based training.},

To guide the benchmarks new metrics were developed that define how well a model has generalized the training set. The generated chemical space is evaluated with respect to its uniformity, closedness and completeness. Results show that models that use {LSTM} cells trained with 1 million randomized {SMILES}, a non-unique molecular string representation, are able to generalize to larger chemical spaces than the other approaches and they represent more accurately the target chemical space. Specifically, a model was trained with randomized {SMILES} that was able to generate almost all molecules from {GDB}-13 with a quasi-uniform probability. Models trained with smaller samples show an even bigger improvement when trained with randomized {SMILES} models. Additionally, models were trained on molecules obtained from {ChEMBL} and illustrate again that training with randomized {SMILES} lead to models having a better representation of the drug-like chemical space. Namely, the model trained with randomized {SMILES} was able to generate at least double the amount of unique molecules with the same distribution of properties comparing to one trained with canonical {SMILES}.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of compounds through manipulating properties at the molecular level is often the key to considerable scientific advances and improved process systems performance. This paper highlights key trends, challenges, and opportunities underpinning the Computer-Aided Molecular Design ({CAMD}) problems. A brief review of knowledge-driven property estimation methods and solution techniques, as well as corresponding {CAMD} tools and applications, are first presented. In view of the computational challenges plaguing knowledge-based methods and techniques, we survey the current state-of-the-art applications of deep learning to molecular design as a fertile approach towards overcoming computational limitations and navigating uncharted territories of the chemical space. The main focus of the survey is given to deep generative modeling of molecules under various deep learning architectures and different molecular representations. Further, the importance of benchmarking and empirical rigor in building deep learning models is spotlighted. The review article also presents a detailed discussion of the current perspectives and challenges of knowledge-based and data-driven {CAMD} and identifies key areas for future research directions. Special emphasis is on the fertile avenue of hybrid modeling paradigm, in which deep learning approaches are exploited while leveraging the accumulated wealth of knowledge-driven {CAMD} methods and tools.},

However, in the case of longer molecules, the existing models seem to under-perform in producing new molecules. In this work, we propose the use of Self-Attention mechanism for Generative Adversarial Networks to allow long range dependencies. Self-Attention mechanism has produced improved rewards in novelty and promising results in generating molecules.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been applied since the early 2000s in all stages of the drug design process. Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of deep learning ({DL}) methodologies, which is supported by the generation of massive drug-related data and the availability of high-performance computational infrastructure. {DL} provides very efficient methodologies and architectures that can handle large volumes of data and are suitable for predicting drug-target interaction properties and for generating innovative molecular structures with improved properties against targets of interest. In this work, we present various {DL} techniques, which have been developed and applied in the field of drug design. After introducing the different approaches for creating electronic representations of molecular structures, we present the state-of-the-art {DL}-supported pharmaceutical discovery, including physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction methods, and de novo drug design approaches based on generative {DL} structures and deep reinforcement learning. In the last section, we present the challenges and the limitations of the current {DL} technologies, to further advance {DL}-assisted drug discovery and design.},
